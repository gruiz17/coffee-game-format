Coffee Game Format
===============
A basic template to make HTML5 Canvas games with CoffeeScript.

I use for all my templates.

Just clone the repo, delete git data, and add in new history for whatever game you want to create. 

Enjoy! Comes with basic Cakefile, main.coffee with initialized canvas on html with css styles.
